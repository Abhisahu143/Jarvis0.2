## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abhisahu143/Jarvis0.2.git
cd Jarvis0.2
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Configure API keys in `config.json`:
```json
{
    "apis": {
        "wolframalpha": "YOUR_WOLFRAM_ALPHA_KEY",
        "openweathermap": "YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_KEY",
        "newsapi": "YOUR_NEWS_API_KEY"
    }
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The `config.json` file allows you to customize JARVIS:

```json
{
    "user": {
        "name": "Sir",
        "email": "",
        "password": ""
    },
    "paths": {
        "music": "",
        "documents": "",
        "downloads": ""
    },
    "preferences": {
        "voice_speed": 1.0,
        "language": "en",
        "temperature_unit": "celsius"
    }
}
```

## üéÆ Usage
